Problem Set 4 is posted on Canvas. You must use the provided RMarkdown file to complete this problem set.

- Use the RMarkdown file provided (.Rmd extension) and write your answers and code in the spaces provided. Submit the PDF that is "knitted" (1 file).^[This route requires a few more tools. You need to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). The upside? You can produce beautiful documents that show your code and output.]

If you have any issues using RMarkdown please see me in my office so we can make sure you can knit the file on your computer.

### Files

1. [Problem Set - PDF](https://agnesscott.instructure.com/files/590456/)
