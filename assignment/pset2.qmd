Problem Set 2 is posted on Canvas. You have two options for how to complete the assignment.

1. Type up your answers in a text processor and write your code in an R script. Submit a PDF of the answers as well as your Rscript (2 files).
2. Use the RMarkdown file provided (.Rmd extension) and write your answers and code in the spaces provided. Submit the PDF that is "knitted" (1 file).^[This route requires a few more tools. You need to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). The upside? You can produce beautiful documents that show your code and output.]



## Purpose

This second problem set will help you practice:

1. Setting the working directory
2. Loading data into R
3. Computing and interpreting the mean of a variable
4. Identifying treatment and outcome variables in a dataset


You will use the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# From the previous problem set
setwd()

read.csv()

# New in this problem set
mean()

```



## Criteria for success

In addition to providing the correct code and/or answer, a successful problem set will:

1. Have clear explanations that demonstrate your knowledge of the material
2. Use the "comment out" function to explain what the code is doing
